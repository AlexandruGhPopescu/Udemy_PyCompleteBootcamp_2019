# Functions and Methods Homework
# Complete the following questions:
#
# Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.
#
# The volume of a sphere is given as $$\frac{4}{3} πr^3$$
#
# In [1]:
# def vol(rad):
#     pass
# In [2]:
# # Check
# vol(2)
# Out[2]:
# 33.49333333333333
# Write a function that checks whether a number is in a given range (inclusive of high and low)
#
# In [3]:
# def ran_check(num,low,high):
#     pass
# In [4]:
# # Check
# ran_check(5,2,7)
# 5 is in the range between 2 and 7
# If you only wanted to return a boolean:
#
# In [5]:
# def ran_bool(num,low,high):
#     pass
# In [6]:
# ran_bool(3,1,10)
# Out[6]:
# True
# Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
#
# Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
# Expected Output :
# No. of Upper case characters : 4
# No. of Lower case Characters : 33
#
# HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()
#
# If you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!
#
# In [7]:
# def up_low(s):
#     pass
# In [8]:
# s = 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
# up_low(s)
# Original String :  Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?
# No. of Upper case characters :  4
# No. of Lower case Characters :  33
# Write a Python function that takes a list and returns a new list with unique elements of the first list.
#
# Sample List : [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5]
# Unique List : [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# In [9]:
# def unique_list(lst):
#     pass
# In [10]:
# unique_list([1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,5])
# Out[10]:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
#
# Sample List : [1, 2, 3, -4]
# Expected Output : -24
# In [11]:
# def multiply(numbers):
#     pass
# In [12]:
# multiply([1,2,3,-4])
# Out[12]:
# -24
# Write a Python function that checks whether a passed in string is palindrome or not.
#
# Note: A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
#
# In [13]:
# def palindrome(s):
#     pass
# In [14]:
# palindrome('helleh')
# Out[14]:
# True
# Hard:
# Write a Python function to check whether a string is pangram or not.
#
# Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
# For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
#
# Hint: Look at the string module
#
# In [15]:
# import string
#
# def ispangram(str1, alphabet=string.ascii_lowercase):
#     pass
# In [16]:
# ispangram("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog")
# Out[16]:
# True
# In [17]:
# string.ascii_lowercase
# Out[17]:
# 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
# Great Job!
