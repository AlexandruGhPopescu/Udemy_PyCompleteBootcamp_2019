Hints and Tips for Functions and Methods Assignment
Here are some hints for helping you complete the assignment!

1. Volume of a sphere
Write out your solution by hand as an equation with an input radius, then try to convert your logic to code.

2. Range check function
Keep in mind how to use the in operator and the range() function.
How can you use in to check if something is in a list?

3. Upper Case and Lower Case strings
Whats a goo way to iterate through the string? A for loop perhaps? How can you keep track of you counts?
A variable or maybe even a dictionary with a key for upper and a key for lower,
Then add counts to the value corresponding to the correct key.

4. Unique numbers in list.
Try using set() or even just using a for loop with a list and append numbers that you haven't already seen

5. Multiply all numbers in a list
Use a for loop to go through the list and take advantage of *= which operate similarly to += .

6. Palindrome check
Remember what s[::-1] does if s is a string, or find a built - in way to reverse a string(function or method)

7. Pangram check
This is really tricky, but try using set() and feel free to check the answer for this one!
